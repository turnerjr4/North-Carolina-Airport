# North-Carolina-Airports
// North Carolina airports in each county. 
//  This map used data from the Humanitarian Data exchange and took a while to process. I hade to clean up the data deleting all airports not whithin North Carolina. I also manually deleted all heliports and closed airports. Secondly I had to manually enter in total airports into the NC GEOJSON file using GEOJSON.IO and adding a field manually.
  //I found an airplane font on fontawesome and got the correct key and verbage in place to change my icon from a genaric point. I also resized it and distinguished the 3 colors I wanted.
  // Line: 113+ I added the airport data and created a bindpop up so that it would show the airport name and elevation. I also distinguished between three different sizes of airports.
  // Next I added my attribuition. 
  //Then I added my color scheme I wanted for the cloropleth section of the map. It was difficult to find one where both airplanes and the county polygons would not interfere with eachother. I spent a considerable amount of time playing around on colorbrewer until I found a combination I liked. I also added the range of airports I wanted to break down in the cloropleth county map.
  // Next I added data to my legend and tied it to the colors I used for the airplane symbols and cloropleth section.
 // Lastly I added a scale bar and polished up a few of my sizes, positions etc.
 
 // This map was fun to make and turned out looking really good. In the future I would like to run a joins and relates to multiple data sets I have. I'd like to make a map that incoorperates airport length and heading.
